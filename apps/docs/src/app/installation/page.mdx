# Quickstart

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Protocol API. We'll cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

<Note>
  Before you can make requests to the Protocol API, you will need to grab your
  API key from your dashboard. You find it under [Settings &raquo; API](#).
</Note>

## Install packages

Before using the Datekit components, you need to install its dependencies.

<CodeGroup>

```bash {{ title: 'npm' }}
npm i --save @datekit/core @datekit/react
```

```bash {{ title: 'yarn' }}
yarn add --save @datekit/core @datekit/react
```

```bash {{ title: 'pnpm' }}
pnpm add @datekit/core @datekit/react
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/sdks" variant="text" arrow="right">
    <>Check out our list of first-party SDKs</>
  </Button>
</div>

## Build your calendar

After picking your preferred client, you are ready to make your first call to the Protocol API. Below, you can see how to send a GET request to the Conversations endpoint to get a list of all your conversations. In the cURL example, results are limited to ten conversations, the default page length for each client.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript {{ title: 'calendar.tsx' }}
  "use client"

  import { Calendar } from '@datekit/react'

  export default function CalendarPage({}) {
    return (
      <Calendar />
    );
  }
```

</CodeGroup>

<div className="not-prose">
  <Button href="/conversations" variant="text" arrow="right">
    <>Read the docs for the Conversations endpoint</>
  </Button>
</div>
